# stackwalk Command

## Overview

The `stackwalk` command in VSDebugPro performs a structured dump of the call stack for the current thread or all threads in the debugged process. It provides a detailed view of the program's execution state, which is crucial for understanding the flow of control and diagnosing issues.

## Syntax

```
stackwalk [-o <filename>] [depth] [all]
```

## Parameters

- `-o <filename>`: Optional. Specifies the output file to write the stack dump. If not provided, the output is displayed in the console.
- `depth`: Optional. Specifies the number of frames to dump per thread. If not provided, all frames are dumped.
- `all`: Optional. If specified, dumps the stack for all threads. Otherwise, only the current thread's stack is dumped.

## Usage Examples

1. Dump current thread's stack to console:
   ```
   stackwalk
   ```

2. Dump current thread's stack to a file:
   ```
   stackwalk -o stack.txt
   ```

3. Dump the first 10 frames of the current thread's stack:
   ```
   stackwalk 10
   ```

4. Dump all threads' stacks to a file:
   ```
   stackwalk -o allstacks.txt all
   ```

5. Dump the first 5 frames of all threads' stacks:
   ```
   stackwalk -o stacks.txt 5 all
   ```

## Output Format

The output of the `stackwalk` command includes the following information for each frame:

- Frame number
- Function name
- Source file and line number (if available)
- Module name
- Instruction pointer address

For each thread (when using the `all` option), it also includes:
- Thread ID
- Thread name (if available)

## Example Output

```
Thread ID: 1234, Name: Main Thread
-------------------------------------------
Frame 0:
  Function: main
  File: c:\project\main.cpp (Line 45)
  Module: myapp.exe
  Address: 0x00007FF65C3012D0

Frame 1:
  Function: initialize
  File: c:\project\init.cpp (Line 23)
  Module: myapp.exe
  Address: 0x00007FF65C301100

...
```

## Notes

- The `stackwalk` command requires the debugger to be in break mode. If the debugger is running, the command will fail.
- Symbol information must be available for best results. Without symbols, some information (like function names and source locations) may be missing.
- The depth of the stack dump may be limited by the debugger or the process being debugged.
- Large stack dumps, especially when dumping all threads, can take some time to generate.

## Related Commands

- `print`: Evaluates and prints the value of a symbol or expression.
- `dumpmem`: Dumps memory contents to a file.

## Best Practices

1. Start with dumping only the current thread's stack before exploring all threads.
2. Use a reasonable depth limit when dealing with deep recursion or very large call stacks.
3. When investigating a specific issue, focus on the relevant threads rather than dumping all threads.
4. Save stack dumps to files for later analysis or comparison.

## Troubleshooting

- If the output lacks detailed information, ensure that debug symbols are loaded correctly.
- If the command fails, make sure the debugger is in break mode and attached to a process.
- For very large applications with many threads, consider using depth limits to avoid excessive output.

By using the `stackwalk` command effectively, you can gain valuable insights into your program's execution state, making it easier to track down bugs and understand complex control flows.
