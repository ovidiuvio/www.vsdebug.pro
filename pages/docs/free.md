##### free (Free Memory Command)
---
##### Description
The `free` command in VSDebugPro is used to release memory that was previously allocated using the `malloc` command. This command is crucial for managing memory during debugging sessions, especially when simulating or testing memory allocation scenarios.

{: .code-box}
>{: .code-header}
>Syntax
```
free <address>
```

##### Parameters

- `<address>`: The memory address to be freed. This should be an address that was previously returned by the [malloc](/pages/docs/malloc.html) command.

##### Behavior

- The `free` command releases the memory block at the specified address, making it available for future allocations.
- After freeing, the memory is no longer valid for use in the debugged process.
- The command does not modify the value of any pointers in the debugged process that may still be pointing to the freed memory.

##### Important Notes

1. **Only free memory allocated by [malloc](/pages/docs/malloc.html)**: Only use `free` on addresses that were returned by the [malloc](/pages/docs/malloc.html) command in VSDebugPro. Attempting to free other addresses may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

2. **Double free**: Freeing the same memory address twice is an error and may cause instability in the debugged process.

3. **Use-after-free**: After freeing memory, any attempts to read from or write to that memory address in the debugged process may result in undefined behavior or crashes.

4. **Pointer updates**: The `free` command does not automatically update or nullify any pointers in your code that may be pointing to the freed memory. It's your responsibility to manage these pointers in your debugging session.

5. **No return value**: The `free` command doesn't return a value. Successful execution is indicated by the absence of error messages.

##### Examples

1. Free memory at a specific address:

   {: .code-box}
   ```
   free 0x00500000
   ```

2. Free memory using a variable that holds the address:

   {: .code-box}
   ```
   free myAllocatedPointer
   ```

##### Best Practices

1. Always pair [malloc](/pages/docs/malloc.html) and `free` calls to prevent memory leaks.
2. Keep track of allocated addresses to ensure all allocations are properly freed.
3. After freeing memory, consider setting any pointers to that memory to `NULL` in your code to prevent accidental use of freed memory.
4. Use this command in conjunction with memory analysis tools to detect memory leaks and invalid memory accesses.

##### Example Workflow

1. Allocate memory:

   {: .code-box}
   ```
   malloc 1024
   ```
   Output: 

   {: .code-box}
   ```
   Allocated: 1024 bytes at address: 0x00500000
   ```

2. Use the allocated memory in your debugging session...

3. Free the allocated memory:

   {: .code-box}
   ```
   free 0x00500000
   ```
   Output: 

   {: .code-box}
   ```
   Released memory at address: 0x00500000
   ```

##### Troubleshooting

- If you receive an error when trying to free memory, double-check that the address is correct and was obtained from a `malloc` call.
- If your debugged process crashes after a `free` call, check for use-after-free scenarios in your code.
- If you suspect memory leaks, use memory analysis tools in conjunction with careful use of `malloc` and `free` to track allocations and deallocations.

##### Caution

The `free` command, like its C/C++ counterpart, is a powerful tool but requires careful use. Improper use can lead to difficult-to-debug issues like heap corruption or use-after-free bugs. Always ensure you're freeing the correct memory and not using it after freeing.
